# about me

I am Jaideep Nutalapati, a Master’s student in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Chicago, with a strong focus on data science, AI, and backend systems. My projects span from building secure chat applications using cryptographic protocols to developing recommendation systems and high-accuracy predictive models. I’m particularly passionate about geospatial and urban data visualization, exploring how city datasets like transit feeds, tree censuses, and environmental data can drive insights into sustainability and urban planning. Beyond academics, I bring hands-on experience as a Backend Developer Intern and a Building Service Aide at UIC, balancing technical rigor with real-world responsibility. My goal is to leverage AI and data-driven systems to create meaningful, responsible, and scalable solutions that connect technology with everyday human challenges.
